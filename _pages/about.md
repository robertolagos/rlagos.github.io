I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research focuses on macroeconomics, informality, and taxation policy. During my doctoral studies, I have worked as a consultant for the World Bank, collaborating with the Chief Economist for Central America and the Dominican Republic. Prior to my Ph.D., I was a research fellow at the Inter-American Development Bank after completing a Master’s degree in Economics at Duke University. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras.
